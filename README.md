This project was inspire after taking a look at the LED lights advertised by creators of Spikeball. The product was about $40, so I expected the kit to connect to the rim and net of the game and be highly interactive.  I was completely wrong. With little more than a micro USB charging kit, the kit simply lights up its surroundings. I knew I could come up with something much more fun. My version uses an accelerometer to detect when the ball hits the net and responds by changing colors with different animations.
